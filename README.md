# AmdahlCalculator
IS303 Architectural Analysis AmdahlCalculator <br><br>

Wrote this simple application to help me with calculations. <br><br>

It helps you to calculate the following: <br> <br>
1) B (%serial) (Enter the number of cores + speed up factor) <br>
2) Speedup factor (Enter the number of cores + B) <br>

Based on the formula:	Sp(n, B) = n / [ (B * n) + (1 â€“ B) ], where n is number of cores. <br>

Special thanks to Duxue for helping me with the maths involved. Good luck! :)<br>
